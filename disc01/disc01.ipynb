This is because the testing cell contains two types of tests: hidden and not hidden, or open. The open tests are the ones you see in Jupyter Hub. They only test very your answer very broadly. For example, here the test is `c>0`. The open tests are worth zero points. The hidden tests are only evaluated in Gradescope. You will see these results when you upload the zip file to Gradescope.
